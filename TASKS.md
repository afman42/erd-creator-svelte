# TASKS

Open work, each with the trigger that makes it worth doing. Done work lives in
git history, not here.

## Deferred — add when trigger fires

- [ ] Drive CSS from the JS constants instead of mirroring them. The numbers
      still live in both places (`geometry.js` and `TableCard.svelte`'s
      `<style>`), but a unit test now parses the CSS and asserts it matches, so
      drift fails at test time. Trigger: a visual bug the test did not catch, or
      a third consumer of the metrics; the real fix is CSS custom properties set
      from `geometry.js`, which removes the duplication rather than guarding it.

## Done elsewhere (trail, not tracking)

- Box geometry vs CSS mismatch: trigger fired — column controls overflowed the
  card by up to 121px, and FK edges drifted 14px by the fourth column, because
  the metrics were hand-copied into CSS *and* re-derived at each call site
  (`layout()` added `24 + GAP`, `addTable()` a bare `36`, and both understated
  the real card by 3px). Fixed by deriving `boxHeight()`/`stackStep()` in
  `geometry.js`, pinning the CSS heights, and adding tests that read the CSS.
  The residue is the deferred item above: the duplication is guarded, not gone.

- Extract fetch glue (lint/save/export round-trips) out of `App.svelte`:
  trigger fired — Playwright e2e covers those round-trips server-side
  (`frontend/e2e/api.spec.js`), so DOM-adapter extraction loses its second
  consumer; retired instead of done.

- splitTop escape fix + geometry/lint split + node --test suites + docs
  sync + stripped binary: shipped as commits 4568625, 649ffb5, 20349ba.
- 50/50 rebalance: grammar (model/generate/parse/lint/inserts) moved to Go
  (`grammar.go`), `.sql` store added (`files.go`), JS grammar half deleted,
  file-picker UX replaced by server file list — pays the grammar-drift debt.
